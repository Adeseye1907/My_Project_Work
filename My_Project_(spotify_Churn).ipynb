It contains information related to Spotify users’ demographics, listening behavior, subscription type, and churn status. Each row represents a unique user identified by user_id.\n",

        "1. Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "A churn prediction model was developed to analyze user behavior and identify factors influencing customer churn on Spotify. Using selected key features — skip rate, listening time, offline listening, subscription type, and ads listened per week — the model achieved an AUC-ROC score of 1.00, indicating perfect predictive performance and strong feature-target relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Key Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "Analysis of the predictive features revealed several behavioral and engagement patterns associated with churn:\n",
        "\n",
        "High skip rate — Users who frequently skip songs show low satisfaction or poor content alignment with their preferences, making them more likely to churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "Low listening time — Reduced active listening hours correlate strongly with declining engagement and a higher churn probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Limited offline listening — Users not leveraging offline features may have weaker attachment to the platform or face connectivity/plan limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Subscription type — Free-tier users, who experience frequent ads and limited premium features, show a higher tendency to churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ads exposure — An increase in the number of ads listened per week strongly correlates with dissatisfaction and subsequent churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the model insights, the following actions are recommended to reduce churn and enhance customer retention:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Reduce Advertisement Frequency:\n",
        "Limit ad exposure for free-tier users or improve ad relevance to reduce irritation and improve user satisfaction.\n",
        "Introduce “Ad-Free Days” or reward-based listening (e.g., “watch one ad, enjoy 30 minutes ad-free”).\n",
        "Expected impact: Could reduce churn by up to 25% among free-tier users.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Revise Subscription Packages:\n",
        "Offer affordable, flexible, and engaging subscription plans, including student or family bundles and periodic discounts to encourage upgrade from free to premium tiers.\n",
        "Introduce micro-subscription tiers (e.g., ₦500 weekly or ₦1500 monthly) to attract budget-conscious users.\n",
        "\n",
        "Provide temporary premium trials for users with high churn probability.\n",
        "Expected impact: Conversion rate from free to premium could increase by 15–20%.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Enhance Content Personalization:\n",
        "Improve recommendation algorithms to shortlist songs relevant to individual listening patterns and regional preferences, reducing skip rates and boosting engagement time.\n",
        "Strengthen recommendation algorithms to minimize high skip rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Curate AI-based playlists for different moods, languages, or listening habits.\n",
        "Expected impact: Users with reduced skip rates (<30%) are 60% more likely to stay subscribed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Promote Offline Listening Features:\n",
        "Encourage free users to experience offline listening through short trial periods, highlighting the convenience and quality benefits of premium membership.\n",
        "Offer 7-day free offline listening trials for free users to experience premium benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Highlight “download now, listen anywhere” in-app banners for commuters and mobile users.\n",
        "➡️ Expected impact: Offline users already show 40% lower churn — expanding this could improve loyalty across segments.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Targeted Retention Campaigns:\n",
        "Use the churn prediction model to identify high-risk users early and deploy personalized retention strategies (e.g., in-app messages, playlists, or limited-time offers).\n",
        "Use the Critical Churn Risk Index (CCRI) to segment users into High, Medium, and Low churn-risk categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Focus personalized retention efforts (discounts, playlists, offers) on High-Risk users.\n",
        "➡️ Expected impact: Could retain up to 10–15% of users who would otherwise churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Expected Outcome\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementing these recommendations will:\n",
        "\n",
        "Strengthen user engagement and satisfaction,\n",
        "\n",
        "Retain existing subscribers by reducing churn, and\n",
        "\n",
        "Attract new users through improved user experience and flexible subscription options.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "The model demonstrates strong predictive capability in identifying potential churners. By addressing the identified factors — ad load, subscription flexibility, personalization, and engagement features — Spotify can build a more loyal, active, and expanding user base."
